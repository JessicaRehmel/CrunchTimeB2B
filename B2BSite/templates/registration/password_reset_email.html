Someone asked to reset the B2B site password associated with the email {{ email }}. To do so, follow the link below:
{{ protocol}}://{{ domain }}{% url 'password_reset_confirm' uidb64=uid token=token %}

If this wasn't you, you should probably update your password anyway, as your account may have been compromised.
If you believe there is a problem, you can reach out to an admin for help or more information.
